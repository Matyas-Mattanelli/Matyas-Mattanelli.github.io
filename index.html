            &emsp;In the <span onclick="changeSection('aboutme')" class="in-text-link">About me</span> section you can find some basic information such as my hobbies and interests.
            The sections <span onclick="changeSection('education')" class="in-text-link">Education</span> and <span onclick="changeSection('work')" class="in-text-link">Work</span> are quite self-explanatory. The former captures

                &emsp;My name is Matyáš Mattanelli and I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence with a specialization in Machine Learning.
                I hold a Bachelor's degree in Economics and Finance and a Master's degree in Economics and Finance with a specialization in Financial Markets and Data Analysis. My 
                studies of Economics provided me with a strong background in Mathematics, Statistics, Econometrics, and Data Analysis. During my Master studies I was introduced
                to coding (firstly in R and later in Python) and subsequently to Machine Learning and I fell in love with both. I am currently improving my knowledge of Computer
                Science in order to be able to pursue a carrer as a Data Scientist/Machine Learning Engineer.
            </p>
            
            <p class="width intro summary">
                &emsp; Even though I spend a significant amount of time in front of my laptop either studying or coding up my personal projects, sports constitute a very important part
                of my life. Apart from Jogging and Calisthenics, I am a competitive Ballroom Dancer. In case you are interested, the results of me and <span id="secret">my partner's</span> competitions are 
                available <a class="in-text-link" href="https://www.csts.cz/dancesport/osobni/10700099/souteze" target="_blank">here</a>. I like to 
                intertwine my passions and thus ballroom dancing has also been a vital part of my programming journey. Apart from several personal tools which I have developed to
                track my competitive record, I also created a desktop application facilitating the organization of ballroom dancing competitions. You can read more about my projects
                <span class="in-text-link" onclick="changeSection('projects')">here</span>. Whenever my busy schedule allows I also enjoy an occasional hike or a good book.
