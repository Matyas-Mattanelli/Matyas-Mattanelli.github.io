    <p class="width intro">
        My name is Matyáš Mattanelli and I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence with a specialization in Machine Learning.
        I hold a Bachelor's degree in Economics and Finance and a Master's degree in Economics and Finance with a specialization in Financial Markets and Data Analysis. My 
        studies of Economics provided me with a strong background in Mathematics, Statistics, Econometrics, and Data Analysis. During my Master studies I was introduced
        to coding (firstly in R and later in Python) and subsequently to Machine Learning and I fell in love with both. I am currently improving my knowledge of Computer
         Science in order to be able to pursue a carrer as a Data Scientist/Machine Learning Engineer.
